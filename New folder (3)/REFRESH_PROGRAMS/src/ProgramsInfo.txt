  and 1 method each for each of 4 functionalities 
  
  
  
2) --> Write java programs to explain polymorphism

   --> class Employee 
         Properties : int id, String name,int salary,double experience
           
           overloaded methods :
             --> generateBonus(int salary)   (BasedOnSalary) 
              (if salary > 9000 then generate 20% of salary as bonus else generate 10% of salary as bonus)
             --> generateBonus(double exp)   (BasedOnExperience)
              (if experience > 5 then generate 20% of salary as bonus else generate 10% of salary as bonus)
              
              
           overridden methods :
              Create class TeamPlayer which extends Employee
                     properties : String role, boolean isOnBench
                     
                     override generateBonus(double exp)  BasedOnExperience in TeamPlayer class 
                       (if experience > 5 and not on bench then generate 30% of salary as bonus)
                       (if experience > 5 and on bench then generate 10% of salary as bonus)
                       (if experience < 5 and not on bench then generate 30% of salary as bonus)
                       (if experience < 5 and on bench then generate 10% of salary as bonus) 
                     
                     
3) --> Write a java program to explain interface and its implementation

Create an interface with name IUser for gathering below requirements
     req 1 : register as a new user 
	   input : User object and index position
	   output : void
	   
     req 2 : login as a user 
   	    input : username, password
	    output : boolean 

    Create an implementation class which implements IUser interface
      class should have a property of User[] with size of 5
       
          while implementing registerUser method if index position is out of bounds (either < 0 or > 4) then throw IndexIncorrectException (user defined exception)
          
          while registering store every object  in the given index position
          
          while login iterate through all the objects in array and find out any matching user present or not 
  
                     
4)  --> Write java program to generate fibonacci series of given limit
  
   
5)   --> Write java program to display data as follows using nested loops 
   
    1 
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10                  
   
   
 6)  --> Write a java program to find out maximum and minimum values in given array 
   
   
 7)  --> Write a java program to find out 2nd highest value in array using java8 streams 
   with and without using java8 
   
 8)  --> Write a java program to find out no of occurrences of every character in a given name using java8 streams 
   
   java
   
   j - 1
   a - 2
   v - 1
   
 9) Given 2 programs
		1: contains Employee pojo
		2: contains Dept pojo
	These pojos have name and id with parameterised constuctor and getter/setter
	Note:
		for this test, create above pojos yourself and use.
		Assumption:
			We have 5 employees and 3 dept as follow
			e1,e2,e3,e4,e5 employees
			d1,d2,d3 departments

	To do:
	write program to map emp with dept such that no duplicate employees allowed and should be sorted based on empId  
   
   
10) Swap 2 numbers with using third variable and without using third variable

11) Write a java program to iterate on ArrayList using for loop, while loop and forEach loop

12) Write a java program to find out whether given input number is prime or not 

13) Write a java program to replace all white spaces in a given sentence
 through with using and without using predefined functions of strings
 
 
-----------------------------------------------
 
14) Write a java program to find out factorial of a given number 

15) Write a java program to remove duplicates from given array with and without using java 8
 Note : use .distinct method
 java7 -- add all values to LinkedHashSet
 
16) Write java program to find out whether input strings are anagrams or not
